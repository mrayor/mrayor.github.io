### Steps to Calculate the total of KWH used per month

To calculate the number of kwh's you use per month

- List the number of watts for each appliance or electronic device (this is called a “load” for each device). All existing and planned electrical loads should be identified.

- Estimate the average daily use (the number of hours each day that the appliance or electronic device is running)

- Multiply the unit's wattage by the number of hours you use it (this will give you a certain amount of “watt-hours”). For example, if you use a 120-watt television for two hours per day. You can multiply the wattage by the number of hours used per day to obtain 240 watt-hours per day.

- On your electric bill, the electricity is in kilowatt-hours. To compare the energy consumption in kilowatt-hours, we will need to convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours. Since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1,000 watts, divide by 1000 to convert from watt-hours (Wh) to kilowatt-hours (kWh):

```
240 Wh / 1000 = 0.24 kWh
```

- if you have a solar panel that each produce x kWh of power per day, you would need a full x solar panel to fully power your home if you consume x kwh.

- To compare these numbers to your electric bill, we need to convert this number to the number of hours that the appliance or device uses per month. For example, 0.24 kWh x 30 days = 7.2 kWh per month.
